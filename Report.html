<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<strong>Pluses: </strong><ul>
<li>Little arguments - Only two group members in this group so arguments about the website were few and far between</li>
<li>Easy cooperation - Only having two members mean't that keeping the whole group up to date easy</li></ul>
<strong>Minuses: </strong><ul>
<li>Started late - Waited until a few days before milestone 1 before beginning work - possibly due to poor communication</li>
<li>Member missing - Our third group member dropped out (or dissappeared off the face of the planet) before the first team meeting - This put a lot of pressure on us to try and get everything done</li>
<li>Minimum communication - Between practical (in which we met up, assigned group tasks etc.) not much communication happend because one of the two group members had trouble accessing the internet</li>
<li>Distance issues</li></ul>
<strong>Interesting: </strong>
<ul><li>That we prefer to work individually</li>
  <li>Dividing up the work properly helps productivity</li>
</ul>
