<h1>The Barrier Reef Orchestra - News</h1>
<h2>President’S Message - Andrew Ryder</h2>
<hr>
<p>Welcome to 2016 which is going to be a stellar year for your Orchestra. Already we have our three major concerts which will include opera, featuring Paul Tabone born in Ingham, but now working the international stage as a tenor based in Italy.  Rachmaninov’s Piano Concerto No.2 featuring last year’s winner of the instrumental section of the ACVC, Arthur Athan.  Our opening performance titled Dreams and Dances is sure to have some favourites such as Afternoon of a Fawn by Debussy.  We are also pleased to be part of the Townsville 150 Concert where we will share the stage with the likes of David Campbell, Luke Kennedy, Bronwyn Douglas and the 1 RAR Band just to name a few of the guests.  We will be back to Queens Gardens for a repeat performance as part of AFCM due to the huge popularity of last year’s concert.  All of these performances are ably managed by our Orchestra Manager, Sally Frewen-Lord and the wonderful team that is your committee.
</p> 
<section class="collapsible" data-collapsed="true" data-collapsible_id="presidentsmessage2k16">
<p>As we look forward to the next milestone for the Orchestra in 2020 it is worthwhile to reflect on the development and struggles the BRO has endured. It is through the Townsville Council’s financial support that started the ball rolling and assisted with seed funding that has allowed BRO to develop to where it is today. Initially, this funding represented the majority of the turnover for BRO. Through the hard work of the committee and the musicians the Council funding is now around 20% of the turnover.  In my opinion this is a substantial move forward and shows the Council’s support is well founded and supported by the public attendance at our concerts.  It is crucial that the support from the Council be maintained into the future to assist BRO to grow.  The funding is not taken as a given and we must all do our bit to let the Council know how important it is to continue the development of BRO for Townsville audiences and local musicians.  I urge all members to make this point as often and as loudly as you can to ensure the Council knows it is getting value for money and meeting the needs of the community.</p>
<p>Finally, the AGM is soon to be upon us and there will be some vacancies on the committee.  My reign of terror will be coming to an end as I will be stepping down, so we will be looking for a new President.  I am flagging this now to allow the search to begin for the next President.  I can assure any prospective nominees that they will find a willing and dynamic committee at their disposal and a myriad of challenges just waiting to be resolved.  I can highly commend this position and would be pleased to speak to anyone considering the position.  See you all at the launch.</p>

<h2>President’s Report for 2015 AGM North Queensland Ensembles Inc. </h2><hr>

<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra is in a sound financial position with concert attendance and revenue from tickets up for 2013.</p>

<p>The Orchestra performed on six occasions over the last 12 months. This included a children’s concert at Riverway featuring music from Harry Potter and Peter and the Wolf. The concert was well received by the audience and the Orchestra got into the mood by dressing up appropriately for their musical characters.</p>

<p>Masterworks conducted by Mark Sheills and featuring the 2013 Australian Concerto and Vocal Competition winner was performed in September with a follow up performance in the Burdekin. Sadly the Burdekin concert was not well attended despite the best efforts in advertising and extra signage.</p>

<section class="collapsible" data-collapsed="true" data-collapsible_id="presidentsreport2k15">

<p>Last Night of the Proms was performed in November and conducted by Richard McIntyre. As expected the audience join in with the antics.</p>

<p>The new year saw the successful season launch at the Pier Restaurant and featured our new harp much to the enjoyment of those present. The Mayor of Townsville, Councillor Jenny Hill, officially launched the 2015 season and spoke of the importance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra to Townsville. Not long after that was Sounds of Romance conducted by Raymond Yong. The issue of parking problems were extreme and the matter was taken up with Council. Hopefully there will not be a repeat performance.</p>

<p>The Orchestra was invited to open the Townsville Arts Awards with a cameo performance of the music from Frozen much to the audiences’ pleasure, particularly with the AV accompaniment. The Barrier Reef Orchestra will conduct the second Conducting Workshop at the end of May as it was so successful in 2013.</p>

<p>For the rest of the year there is our support to the AFCM concert, our World Music Concert commissioned by the Civic Theatre (a first for BRO), support to DanceNorth with their Twilight performances and lastly a Musical Feast for November.</p>

<p>To make all of this happen there is a dynamic and committed committee working away to bring this all together. I thank them all for their magnificent work. My thanks also goes to our major sponsor the Townsville City Council, our generous benefactors and to the Orchestra Manager Sally Frewen-Lord who has found time to run a survey for the musicians to get some feedback on how we do business. Thank you all.</p>

<p>Jeff Nielsen has reworked our website and taken great steps forward in producing a functional and relevant website. Jeff is handing it over to the next person to continue the good work, Thanks Jeff. I will be introducing life members later as a way of marking the Barrier Reef Orchestra 15th Anniversary.</p>

<p>The Barrier Reef Orchestra has taken the opportunity to be directly involved with the development of the TPAC proposal. I see it as necessary support to all of the arts organisations to promote the need for more performance spaces in Townsville and I would urge you all to visit the website and help spread the word. Simon has injected himself into this project with the usual eye for detail while keeping appraised of the macro developments in Townsville. Thanks Simon for your energy and incisive views on this important project.</p>

<p>The 15th anniversary year of BRO has been marked by several approaches to the Orchestra to perform in support of other arts organisations. I take this as a sign of confidence others see in our Orchestra and acceptance of the Barrier Reef Orchestra as Townsville’s resident cultural cornerstone to orchestral music. A fitting milestone for the 15th year of the Barrier Reef Orchestra. </p>
